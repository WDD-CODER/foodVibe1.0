# Agent instructions for foodVibe 1.0

When you iterate on this project — whether from Cursor or from another agent — **read the How We Work file first**. It is the single entry point for how we work and links to all skills you must follow.

**How We Work**: [.assistant/HOW-WE-WORK.md](.assistant/HOW-WE-WORK.md)

That file tells you:

- When to use **save-plan** (e.g. "save the plan") and where plans go (`plans/`).
- When to use **commit-to-github** and that you must not run git writes until the user approves the plan.
- When to use **cssLayer** (any time you create, update, or refactor `.scss` or `.css`) and that you must read `src/styles.scss` and follow the skill before styling.
- Links to **Angular**, **service layer**, **utility standards**, **tech debt**, **update-docs**, **elegant-fix**, and **github-sync** skills for the relevant tasks.

Follow the linked skills for every change that falls under their scope.
