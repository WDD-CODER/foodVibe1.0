name: worktree-setup
description: One-time provisioning of the 3 permanent Planner-Worker slots (wt-1..3). Not automatic — invoke only when a slot is missing or being (re)initialized.

# Skill: worktree-setup
**Model Guidance:** Use Haiku/Flash throughout — this is mechanical.

**Trigger:** User says "setup worktree" or "new worktree" (on-demand only).

> **Not the take-plan flow.** Starting work on a plan is "execute plan NNN" / "take plan
> NNN" (see `.claude/commands/take-plan.md`), which reuses an already-initialized slot.
> This skill only creates the 3 permanent slots the first time, or repairs a missing one.

## What this does

Ensures `../foodVibe1.0-wt-1`, `../foodVibe1.0-wt-2` and `../foodVibe1.0-wt-3` exist as git
worktrees, each detached at `origin/main`, each with its own `.worktree-root` /
`.worktree-port`, dependencies installed, and `server/.env` copied. It starts no servers —
`scripts/take-plan.mjs` does that when a plan is actually taken.

---

## Phase 1 — Migrate the legacy parallel worktree (one-time)

If `../foodVibe1.0-wt-parallel` exists:

1. Remove the one known disposable artifact before the cleanliness check:
   `../foodVibe1.0-wt-parallel/.claude/dev-server.log` (a log file the retired
   `claim-parallel-slot.sh` wrote on every claim — not real work, safe to delete).
2. `git -C ../foodVibe1.0-wt-parallel status --porcelain` — if anything remains, **stop and
   report** the dirty/unpushed state to the Human; do not touch the worktree further.
3. If clean: `git worktree move ../foodVibe1.0-wt-parallel ../foodVibe1.0-wt-1`.

If `../foodVibe1.0-wt-parallel` does not exist, skip this phase.

---

## Phase 2 — Create missing slots

For each of `wt-1`, `wt-2`, `wt-3` whose directory does not already exist:

```bash
git worktree add --detach ../foodVibe1.0-wt-<N> origin/main
```

Idle slots are always detached at `origin/main` — never on `main`, never on a branch.

---

## Phase 3 — Provision each slot

For every slot directory (existing after Phase 1, or just created in Phase 2):

1. `npm install` at the slot root and inside `server/`.
2. Write `.worktree-root` (absolute path back to the main repo) and `.worktree-port` (the
   slot's frontend port — `420N` for `wt-N`, matching the port map in `AGENTS.md`).
3. Copy `server/.env` from the main repo into the slot's `server/.env` — silent skip if
   missing. (This repo only has `server/.env`; there is no root `.env` to copy.)
4. Start no servers — `take-plan.mjs` starts the backend and `ng serve -c slot` when a plan
   is actually taken.

---

## Completion Gate

Output one line per slot:
```
wt-N: <created | migrated | already present> — deps installed, .env copied
```

Then: `3 slots ready. In a free slot, say "execute plan NNN" to start work.`
