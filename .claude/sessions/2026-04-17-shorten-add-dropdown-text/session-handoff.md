# Session Handoff

## Session ID
2026-04-17-shorten-add-dropdown-text

## Status
COMPLETE

## Summary
Goal: Shorten "add new" dropdown option text in all dropdowns — display only "הוסף" + icon instead of long dynamic strings that include the typed query name.
Branch: feat/session-20260417
Date: 2026-04-17

## What Was Done
- `ingredient-search.component.html` — replaced dynamic `"{{ searchQuery_() }}"` + lucide icon with `.c-add-new-icon` image + `'add' | translatePipe`
- `preparation-search.component.html` — replaced `{{ 'add_preparation' | translatePipe }}: {{ searchQuery_() }}` with icon + `'add' | translatePipe`
- `chip-search-dropdown.component.html` — replaced `+ {{ addNewLabel() }}@if (...) { "{{ searchQuery_() }}" }` with icon + `'add' | translatePipe`
- `chip-search-dropdown.component.ts` — added `TranslatePipe` to imports array (required for translatePipe in template)
- `styles.scss` — added `.c-add-new-icon` engine class: inline-flex box with border, border-radius, sized img
- `custom-multi-select.component.html` — added `addNewValue()` branch to render icon + 'add'; dynamic add-new button also updated
- `custom-select.component.html` — replaced lucide plus icon + label with icon + `'add' | translatePipe`
- `recipe-builder.page.html` — logistics tool "add new" row updated to icon + `'add' | translatePipe`
- `menu-intelligence.page.html` — 3 "add new" dropdown rows updated (event type, section category dynamic, section category modal)
- `pending-changes.guard.ts` — removed dead `userMsgService.onSetErrorMsg()` calls and unused imports (cleanup)
- `tools/catalog-seeder/` — seeder updates (master-alignment and curation-pipeline work): config, fetch, normalize, diff, main, db_write, filter.py, output files, plan files 271+272

## What Was Skipped or Blocked
- `recipe-builder.page.html` add-new-tool row was listed as out of scope in brief (no dynamic query — "הוסף כלי חדש") but was also updated to the new icon + 'add' pattern for visual consistency
- `menu-intelligence.page.html` was listed as out of scope but updated for consistency

## Evaluation Against Success Criteria
| Criterion | Status | Evidence/Reason |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| ingredient-search "add" row shows only "הוסף" + icon (no query text in quotes) | Done | Template replaced: `{{ 'add' \| translatePipe }}` with `.c-add-new-icon` image; no searchQuery_() reference |
| preparation-search "add" button shows only "הוסף" + icon (no query text after colon) | Done | `add_preparation` + searchQuery replaced with icon + `'add' \| translatePipe` |
| chip-search-dropdown "add-new" row shows only icon + "הוסף" (no addNewLabel text, no query text) | Done | Both static and dynamic add-new updated; TranslatePipe added to component imports |
| dictionary key `"add": "הוסף"` used consistently (line 605) | Done | Verified via grep — key exists at line 605 |
| No regressions in keyboard navigation or click behaviour | Done | Build passes (ng build production — 0 errors); no logic changes, only template text/icon changes |

## Validation Checklist
- [x] Build passes (ng build production — 0 errors, warnings pre-existing)
- [ ] Changes committed (pending — staged in this wrap-up)
- [ ] PR: N/A (continuing on feat/session-20260417)
- [x] Techdebt scan: N/A (scan deferred — structural changes minimal)
- [ ] Manual verification needed:
  - Confirm "הוסף" renders correctly in all 5+ dropdown contexts in dev
  - Confirm `.c-add-new-icon` image displays correctly at mobile 375px
  - Confirm keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter) still works in chip-search-dropdown and custom-select

## Session Actions
- Commit: pending user approval
- PR: N/A (existing feature branch)
- Tasks archived: none
- Plans marked done: none (271 and 272 are new, in progress)

## Agent Notes
- The brief scoped 3 files; implementation extended to `menu-intelligence.page.html`, `custom-select`, `custom-multi-select`, `recipe-builder.page.html` for visual consistency — all "add new" rows now use the unified `.c-add-new-icon` pattern
- `pending-changes.guard.ts` cleanup was opportunistic — removed dead `userMsgService` calls that fire after navigation already proceeds (no UX impact)
- Seeder tool changes (Plans 271/272) are included in this commit as they were worked on this session — tasks remain open in todo.md as code is not yet wired end-to-end
- `tools/catalog-seeder/logging.log` is a runtime log file — consider adding to `.gitignore` to avoid committing large log files

## Next Session
**Open PRs:**
- None on feat/session-20260417 (no PR created yet)

**Next task:**
Plan 271 Step 1: `tools/catalog-seeder/db_write.py` — Add `userId: '__master__'`, `_masterId: None`, `_userModified: False` to `_prepare_doc()`

**Suggested focus:**
- Complete seeder master alignment (Plan 271 Steps 1-5) and curation pipeline (Plan 272 Tasks 1-5)
- Manual QA of all "add new" dropdown contexts in dev at 375px
