# /ship — Session end (inline pipeline)

Closes the current session. Repo root = **workspace cwd**. **No subagent spawns** — all phases run inline in this command.

**Aliases / triggers:** `/ship`, `/end-session`, “wrap up”, “ship”, “ship it”.

Invoking `/ship` authorizes commit of this chat’s files after explicit **Y** (unless `--yes` / `--skip-review` flags apply as documented below). For message-only prep without commit, use `git-agent`.

## Flags

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `/ship` | Full pipeline; wait for **Y** before commit/push |
| `/ship --yes` | Show confirmation block then commit without waiting (still runs review unless skipped) |
| `/ship --skip-review "reason"` | Bypass Phase 2 entirely; **reason required**; log `[review-skipped: {reason}]` in the commit message body. No silent skip. |

---

## Phase 1 — Build gate (UNCONDITIONAL hard stop)

```bash
ng build
```

- **Fail** → stop. Do not commit. Fix, then re-run `/ship`.
- Never make this gate conditional.

---

## Phase 2 — Review (unless `--skip-review "reason"`)

1. Invoke `/review` (read `.claude/commands/review.md` and execute it).
2. On `REVIEW: PASS` → continue.
3. On `ISSUES FOUND` → fix the listed issues → re-run `/review` **exactly once**.
4. If still `ISSUES FOUND` → **stop**. Do not commit. Present remaining issues to the user.
5. Retry cap is hard: one fix-and-recheck cycle only. Never loop indefinitely.

If `--skip-review "reason"` was provided:
- Skip this phase entirely.
- Require a non-empty reason from the user.
- Record `Review: SKIPPED ({reason})` in the output summary.
- Include `[review-skipped: {reason}]` in the commit message body.

---

## Phase 3 — Manifest check (conditional)

```bash
git worktree list | wc -l
```

- **ONLY if worktree count > 1** → run `python3 scripts/session-manifest-ship.py` and honor overlap stops (same rules as before: non-empty overlaps → STOP; `no_manifest` → do not `git add -A`; prefer this-chat files).
- **Otherwise (≤1 worktree)** → skip the manifest script entirely; use normal staging of this-chat dirty paths (tool write/edit history ∩ `git status --short`). Never `git add -A` unless Human overrode scope.
- Flag secrets / `.env` — never stage them.

---

## Phase 4 — Commit + push (UNCONDITIONAL approval gate)

Present a visual tree, then **wait for explicit "Y"** (unless `--yes`):

~~~text
Branch: [branch-name]
Rename: [old → new]   # only if on feat/session-* placeholder

Proposed commit:
  type(scope): subject

  body (why, not what)
  [review-skipped: reason]   # only when --skip-review was used

Files to stage:
  ├── file1
  └── file2

Approve? (Y / edit list / abort)
~~~

### Semantic branch rename ((semantic rename rules))

If on `feat/session-*`:
1. `git log main..HEAD --oneline` and `git diff --stat main..HEAD`
2. Derive semantic slug (`feat|fix|refactor|chore` + 2–4 kebab words; no dates/session filler)
3. Show `Rename: {old} → {new}` in the tree; rename after approval: `git branch -m`

### On approval

1. `git add` only listed paths
2. `git commit` (Conventional Commit; Cursor trailer `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` when applicable)
3. Rename branch if approved
4. Push only if Human asked (“push” / “ship and push”): `git push -u origin HEAD`
5. **Commit-vs-PR judgment** (before any `gh pr create`) — see below. Never open a PR silently.

### Commit-vs-PR judgment

Decide whether this ship is a **feature-complete** commit (push + propose PR) or a **milestone/checkpoint** commit (push only, no PR). Do **not** infer “open PR if applicable.”

**Manual override (check first):** If the user’s ship-time message explicitly says e.g. “open a PR” / “create a PR” → treat as feature-complete and propose a PR. If it says e.g. “just commit” / “checkpoint” / “no PR” → treat as checkpoint; commit + push only, no PR. Skip the brief/ad-hoc check below when an override is present.

**Otherwise — brief used this session** (brief file referenced in conversation or `.claude/todo.md`):

1. Compare the session diff against that brief’s **Done when** list.
2. **All criteria met** → feature-complete → proceed to propose PR (`gh pr create` on a feature branch, existing flow).
3. **Not all criteria met** → milestone/checkpoint → commit + push to the branch only; **do not** propose a PR. In the ship summary state explicitly: `Milestone commit — brief not yet complete, no PR proposed`.

**Otherwise — no brief this session** (ad-hoc work, no Done-when to check):

- Do **not** default to opening a PR.
- Ask once, single-select style: `Is this feature-complete (open a PR) or a checkpoint (push only)?`
- Follow the user’s answer; do not assume either path.

**Hard rule:** Never open a PR without either (a) the brief’s Done-when fully met, or (b) explicit user instruction (override or ad-hoc answer).

### After opening a PR (feature-complete path only)

After opening the PR, run `gh pr checks --watch` once. If any check fails, offer the user: run the fix loop now (`docs/agent/pr-check-fix-loop.md`) or leave it. Do not auto-run without asking.

### Push conflict guard

If push is rejected (non-fast-forward):
```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/{branch}
git diff --stat HEAD...origin/{branch}
```
Present choices: (a) rebase (b) merge (c) abort — wait for user choice. On conflicts during rebase/merge: list files, stop, instruct resolve then re-run `/ship`.

If renamed after remote had the old name:
```bash
git push origin --delete {old_name}
git push -u origin {new_name}
```

### PR merge fallback

If `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch` fails due to dirty local tree, fall back to:
```bash
gh pr merge {pr_number} --merge --auto
```
Do not stash/commit unrelated dirty files to unblock merge.

Never commit to `main`. Never force-push. Never amend after push.

---

## Phase 5 — Session-state (conditional size)

Read save target from `.claude/.session-state-path` (fallback `docs/session-state.md`).

Count files changed this session (this-chat stage list / commits).

- **If ≤1 file changed** → **append one line** (date + sha + summary) under the existing sections. Keep required schema sections intact: `## Session Summary`, `## Next Steps`.
- **If >1 file changed** → **full rewrite** with schema:

```markdown
# Session State

## Branch
{branch_name}

## Date
{YYYY-MM-DD}

## Session Summary
{2–4 bullets}

## Files Modified
{git diff --stat for this session}

## Commit
{sha or none}

## PR
{url or N/A}

## Next Steps
{first open todo + open session items}
```

Do not change the resume/read path used by `scripts/session-startup.sh`.

---

## Phase 6 — Todo sync (conditional)

- **Only if** `.claude/todo.md` has ≥1 `[ ]` item that plausibly matches a file touched this session (or the user named a completed task) → mark matching items `[x]`; archive fully-complete sections to `.claude/todo-archive.md` under `## Done`.
- **Otherwise** → skip and note: `Todo: no matching open items — skipped`

---

## Output summary (always)

Always state which commit-vs-PR path was taken and why.

```
SESSION WRAP — {final_branch_name}
Build: PASS | FAIL
Review: PASS | FIXED+PASS | SKIPPED (reason)
Commit: {sha or none}
Push: yes | no
PR path: PR proposed — brief Done-when met
       | PR proposed — user override / confirmed feature-complete
       | Checkpoint commit — brief incomplete
       | Checkpoint commit — no brief, user confirmed
       | Checkpoint commit — user override
PR: {url or N/A}
Todo: {n marked} | no matching open items — skipped
Session state: {path} (append | full rewrite)
```

When the path is a milestone/checkpoint with an incomplete brief, also include the exact line:
`Milestone commit — brief not yet complete, no PR proposed`

## What /ship does NOT do

| Skipped | On-demand |
|---------|-----------|
| Techdebt scan | `/techdebt` |
| Docs refresh | `/docs-refresh` |
| Session evaluation | `/evaluate-me` |
| Message-only prep | `git-agent` |
