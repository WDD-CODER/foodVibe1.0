# Plan XXX — [Feature Name]

Status: draft | active | done
Snapshot: [origin/main SHA the plan was verified against — leave filled in if the Architect already set it; save-plan only fills this when empty, never overwrites]

## Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve for the user?]

## Goals & Success Criteria
- Primary: [measurable outcome]
- Success: [how we know it's done]

## Execution Mode
- Parallel: yes | no — will this run alongside other active plans?
- Concurrent plans: [list, if parallel: yes]
- Isolated DB: no | yes — yes only when this plan migrates or reshapes data

## Read-Write Scope

Always allowed regardless of the list below: this plan file itself, its own
`docs/session-state-<branch>.md`, `.claude/sessions/**`, `.worktree-*`, and the append-only
hotspots (`src/styles.scss`, `public/assets/data/dictionary.json`, `src/app/app.routes.ts`
— add to them, never rewrite or remove an existing entry without escalating).

```scope
[one glob per line, prefer folder globs; # for comments]
```

## Read Scope

Entire repo. Analysis and architectural suggestions are expected.

## Escalation Protocol

Thinking outside the box is expected; writing outside it requires explicit consent. If a
Worker needs a file outside the `## Read-Write Scope` above: STOP, tell the Human the file,
the exact change, and why it can't be done in-scope; wait for `approved: <path>`; then
append the path to the scope block above and retry.

## Step 0 — Reality Check

Runs only when `scope-check.mjs --drift` reports `REALITY: drift`. Check the listed commits
by symbol (do not re-run the whole reality check from scratch), then STOP for a go before
touching any milestone.

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have (P0)
- [ ] [Specific, testable requirement]

### Should Have (P1)
- [ ] [Requirement]

### Nice to Have (P2)
- [ ] [Requirement]

## UI/UX Notes
- [Layout expectations, Hebrew text considerations]
- [Which translation keys are needed in dictionary.json]

## Atomic Sub-tasks
- [ ] A1: [First atomic task]
- [ ] A2: [Second atomic task]
- [ ] ...

## Technical Considerations
- Dependencies: [existing services/components affected]
- New files needed: [list]
- Model changes: [any interface/type updates]
- Hebrew canonical values: [if the feature accepts user-entered units, categories, allergens, or section/preparation categories → flag the Hebrew canonical values guidance in `.claude/rules/domain.md`; the canonical resolution flow and translation modal UX are required]

## Out of Scope
[Explicitly list what is NOT included]

## Critical Questions
[Q&A format per the `brief-detection` skill — multiple choice, never open-ended]
