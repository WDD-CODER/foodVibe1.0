# Git commit / push — always use the skill

When the user asks to **commit**, **push**, **save to GitHub**, **save to branches**, or similar (any phrasing, any chat):

1. **Read and follow** `.assistant/skills/commit-to-github/SKILL.md` from start to finish.
2. **Do not** run `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout`, or `git push` until the user has approved the visual plan in that process.

The skill is the single source of truth for phases, branch naming, and execution steps.
