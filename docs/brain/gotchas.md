## Removing a git worktree from inside itself

**What hurt:** `git worktree remove <path>` fails (or leaves a dangling lock) when the shell's cwd is still inside that worktree — the process holds an open handle on the directory.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Retrying with `--force` clears the worktree registration but can leave orphaned `.git/worktrees/<name>` metadata behind; it doesn't address the actual cause (cwd still inside the target).

**What to do instead:** `cd` back to the main repo root before running `git worktree remove`; follow up with `git worktree prune` if metadata lingers. See `.claude/skills/worktree-setup/SKILL.md` and `scripts/prune-merged-worktrees.sh`.

## `gh pr create` failing on PAT scope

**What hurt:** `gh pr create` fails (often with an unhelpful permissions error) when the token behind `gh auth` lacks the scope a PR touching `.github/workflows/*` needs — common with fine-grained PATs issued without `workflow` scope.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Re-running the command or re-authenticating with the same token doesn't help — the scope is fixed at token-issue time, not session time.

**What to do instead:** When a workflow-touching PR fails to create, check `gh auth status` scopes first; regenerate the PAT with `workflow` scope rather than retry-looping the same command.

## `node --watch` full-restart on every server edit

**What hurt:** `server/package.json`'s `dev` / `dev:local` / `dev:remote` scripts all run `node --watch index.js` — any saved file change triggers a full process restart, dropping in-flight requests and any in-memory state.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** There's nothing to "fix" here — the restart is `node --watch`'s designed behavior, not a bug. Debouncing or ignoring it doesn't help.

**What to do instead:** Expect a short gap (~1s) after any server-side edit before requests succeed again; don't fire requests immediately after editing server code in the same script/test run.

## Production logs silently vanish when `logServerUrl` is unset

**What hurt:** `environment.prod.ts` ships with `logServerUrl: ''`. `LoggingService.sendToLogServer()` (`src/app/core/services/logging.service.ts:19`) silently `return`s when the URL is empty — production logs meant for the remote log server disappear with no error, no console warning, nothing surfaced.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Adding more `logger.*()` calls doesn't help if the transport itself is a silent no-op — the gap is invisible until someone specifically checks whether `logServerUrl` is configured for that environment.

**What to do instead:** Before relying on remote log capture in prod, confirm `environment.prod.ts` actually has `logServerUrl` set — otherwise check the browser console directly instead of assuming server-side logs exist.

## Context compaction can silently drop decisions

**What hurt:** When a long Claude Code session's context window compacts, decisions or task state that only ever lived in conversation (never written to a file) can be summarized away — especially something decided a few tool calls before a compaction boundary.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Trusting "the summary will capture it" isn't safe — summarization prioritizes recent/salient content, not necessarily the one decision that turns out to matter later.

**What to do instead:** Persist load-bearing state to disk as it's decided (`docs/session-state.md`, `.claude/todo.md`, plan files under `plans/`) rather than leaving it only in conversation. This is also why `docs/brain/` exists as its own durable layer — see [[0002-file-based-memory-over-tool-memory]].

## `npm audit fix --force` would force an unplanned Angular major bump

**What hurt:** Remaining root `npm audit --audit-level=high` findings sit in the Angular/* cluster (plus related CLI/build toolchain packages: vite, piscina, http-proxy-middleware, serialize-javascript). Running `npm audit fix --force` would auto-bump Angular to satisfy them — but the app is on Angular 19 and isn't ready for that jump.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** `--force` looks like the fast way to clear audit noise, but it silently majors-bumps a framework dependency outside any planned migration window, which can break the build in ways unrelated to the actual vulnerability.

**What to do instead:** Leave these findings alone until the Angular 22 migration. CI temporarily runs `--audit-level=critical` in `.github/workflows/security.yml` as the interim gate; restore `--audit-level=high` after the migration. Server-side `npm audit` is already clean. See `.claude/todo.md`.

## Login reload bypasses deferred constructor load

**What hurt:** Plan 289 deferred venue / menu-event / section-category constructor fetches, but Equipment and Preparations still hit the network on cold dashboard after login. Removing constructor `loadInitialData()` alone was not enough — `UserService._reloadDataServices()` still called `reloadFromStorage()` unconditionally for those services on every auth hydrate.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Treating “no constructor load” as “no bootstrap GET” ignores the login/guest path, which constructs the service and forces a full rehydrate. Keeping the service eager “because recipe-builder needs it” also skips the cheaper fix: wire `ensureLoaded()` on the recipe-builder route.

**What to do instead:** For every deferred singleton data service, gate login reload with `hasLoaded()` (skip until first route/tab hydrate). Wire `ensureLoaded()` on owning resolvers / first UI surface. See [[defer-singleton-data-ensureLoaded]].

---

## Pasted plans that never hit `plans/`

**What hurt:** Big plans authored in one IDE (or chat) were copy-pasted into Cursor/Claude for brief-by-brief execution, but nothing forced a write under `plans/`. Mid-flight stages lived only in conversation or `.claude/todo.md`, so agents could not see the live contract.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Relying on “remember to save the plan” fails — save-plan only ran on an explicit phrase, and number-collision checks did not catch same-topic renames.

**What to do instead:** Any pasted Plan Contract triggers `.claude/skills/save-plan/SKILL.md` first. Run `node scripts/plan-name-similarity.mjs --name="…"`. Ask rewrite/save-as-new/cancel **only** on similar name hits. Append mid-brief tasks to the parent plan’s Atomic Sub-tasks + ledger. Claude PreToolUse: `scripts/plan-write-guard.sh`; Cursor: `.cursor/rules/save-plan-must-use-skill.mdc`.

## PreCompact FAIL substring matches review PASS/FAIL

**What hurt:** A PreCompact transcript grep used loose `FAIL` / `Verify:` tokens. Ordinary `/review-it` tables (`| PASS/FAIL |`, `| Verify cmd |`) and quoted session text were dumped into `.claude/todo.md` as “unresolved signals,” polluting the compact-time ledger.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Dropping signal capture entirely loses the Brief 1 goal (preserve open blockers across `/compact`). Matching only “FAIL” with `\b` still hits `PASS/FAIL` because `/` is a word boundary.

**What to do instead:** Anchor real tool tokens (`UPGRADE_AVAILABLE`, `ROUTING_DECLINED`, `BLOCKED`); require `Verify:` + whitespace; require `FAIL` with a non-`/` predecessor; truncate each match (`cut -c1-300`) so JSONL lines cannot flood `todo.md`.

## Existing save-plan mitigations still let a plan skip plans/

**What hurt:** The gotcha above ("Pasted plans that never hit `plans/`") already
documents save-plan + `plan-write-guard.sh` + the Cursor `.mdc` rule as the fix —
yet Plan 285 (AI Menu Phase 1) still executed end-to-end with ~22 `.claude/todo.md`
items marked `[x]` and no `plans/285-*.plan.md` ever created. The mitigations
existed on paper and were still bypassed, silently, with no error.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Assuming "the gate exists" means "the gate
caught it" ignores two concrete bypass paths neither gate covers: (1)
`.claude/commands/plan.md` / `feat.md` / `review-it.md` documented a second,
ungated plan-path convention (`plans/[feature]_v[N].md`) that
`plan-name-similarity.mjs` and `plan-write-guard.sh` never recognized — a plan
saved under that name skips both checks; (2) `brief-detection`'s 3-marker H2
threshold also matches a genuine Plan Contract (Milestones + Atomic Sub-tasks),
and its execute-as-is route goes straight to `/feat` without ever mentioning
save-plan.

**What to do instead:** Treat "the skill exists" as necessary but not
sufficient — verify with a ledger-integrity check
(`scripts/plan-ledger-check.mjs`, wired into `.husky/pre-commit` and `/ship`
Phase 1) that every plan path referenced in `.claude/todo.md` / session briefs
actually resolves on disk. Collapse to one plan-path convention
(`plans/NNN-slug.plan.md` only). Make `brief-detection` check for a
Milestones/Atomic-Sub-tasks shape *before* offering the brief a/b/c gate,
routing Plan-Contract-shaped pastes to save-plan first. See
`plans/291-plan-persistence-brief-sync-hardening.plan.md`.

## Orphaned instruction file looks wired but nothing loads it

**What hurt:** `.claude/instructions/validation-checklist.md` fully specified HOW TO VALIDATE, but it was only `@`-included from `execute-it.md`. After that command was removed, agents still had JOB DONE close-out and looked compliant — Humans never got click-test bullets.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Adding more “remember to show a checklist” reminders (or leaving the orphan file intact) does not restore enforcement. Agents follow hard gates they already load (`job-validation`, ship, done), not orphaned instruction paths.

**What to do instead:** Move the live rules onto `docs/agent/job-validation.md` and the close-out templates agents must print; leave the old path as a pointer stub. Audit `@include` / skill triggers whenever deleting a command that was the only loader. See [[how-to-validate-on-job-gate]].

## Todo archive footer wording and Plan Index placement

**What hurt:** Fully-done `### Plan` sections sitting *below* `## Plan Index` were invisible to `scripts/todo-archive.mjs` (footer cut-off), so dead weight stayed in `todo.md`. Separately, changing the `## Done` stub text away from a recognized phrase caused the stub to be swallowed into the last archived plan section. Keeping a large Plan Index table in `todo.md` also re-bloated the open-work file after Done rows were moved out.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Re-running the archive script “successfully” looks healthy while orphan all-`[x]` sections remain. A “slim” Active/Planned index still costs ~90 lines every session and mostly duplicates stale catalog state.

**What to do instead:** Keep every `### Plan` block above the file footer (`## Where things live`). Do not maintain a Plan Index table in `todo.md` — open work is the sections; Done is `todo-archive/`; all files are under `plans/`. Archive only via `node scripts/todo-archive.mjs`. See `docs/agent/job-validation.md` → Todo archive volumes.

## Tracked session-state pointer dirties every ship/merge

**What hurt:** `.claude/.session-state-path` was tracked in git but rewritten on every SessionStart (`session-startup.sh`) to a PPID-keyed path. `/ship` also wrote session-state *after* commit/push. Result: perpetual dirty trees and `gh pr merge --delete-branch` failing on local checkout.

**Why the obvious fix is wrong:** Committing the updated pointer “to clean the tree” just schedules the next SessionStart to dirty it again. Leaving Phase 5 until after push guarantees an uncommitted handoff file.

**What to do instead:** Keep `.claude/.session-state-path` gitignored (local pointer only). Save to stable `docs/session-state-${BRANCH}.md` (no PPID). On `/ship`, write that file after commit, amend before push. See Plan 295 / `.claude/commands/ship.md` Phase 5.
